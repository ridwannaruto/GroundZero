Organization Benefits

The primary benefit is to help SL2College provide a more efficient service to the students who are willing to pursue higher education.

Other benefits
----------------------------------

1. Our system provides a balanced rating for a volunteer (to select for professional development programs) considering not only the leader’s ratings. We consider the past performances, how that volunteer has carried out his responsibilities in the past and the availability of that person in the time slot allocated for an event. Which could not have done with the existing manual system. 

2. Reduced error percentage than manual processing of volunteer data. Because considering all the above-mentioned aspects to select candidates for the professional development programs are not possible to do manually. Therefore, the selection of volunteers were not accurate.

3. Replacing the task of manual processing, by our system reduces cost. Thus providing effective usage of sponsors’ donations.

4. Volunteer can improve his/her performance by analyzing his Progress. 

5. Support Administration in accurate decision making for selecting significant volunteers for professional development programs.

6. Convenient event management by handling unpredictable absentees of assigned volunteers.
